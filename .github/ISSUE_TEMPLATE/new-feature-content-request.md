**Describe the new content request**
Give a clear description of what you would like to see on the website. The more detail you can provide, the better.

**Describe how this relates to the FishMIP community**
What would this feature or content allow the community to do that they can't do already (or can't do easily)? Who would you expect to use this feature?

**Describe examples you've seen**
Have you seen this kind of feature/content somewhere else - e.g. ISIMIP, AgMIP, another site? Provide a link to it and describe why you think it works there, and why it would be a good addition to the FishMIP site.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
We probably won't be able to implement every suggestion, as much as we'd like to. Describe any alternative solutions you've considered, especially if your request is large. E.g. a data dashboard would be nice, but could a list of links work too?

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the request here.

**Contact**
If you would like to be contacted regarding this content, please let us know how we can get in touch with you.
