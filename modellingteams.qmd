title: "Modeling Teams"
---

FishMIP simulations would not happen without the contributions of many marine ecosystem modellers working together from different regions of the world.

For more detailed information on each modelling team's past contributions to ISIMIP simulations and how to cite their outputs please see [here.](https://www.isimip.org/impactmodels/)

FishMIP is an open community and continues to grow. Currently we have 9 global modelling teams and over 30 regional marine ecosystem modellers spanning. Please refer to our Protocol Page to participate in our Simulation Rounds.
