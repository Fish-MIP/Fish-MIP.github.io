NOAA's National Ecosystem Modeling Workshop (NEMoW) and FishMIP coordinated a joint meeting to assess and expand regional climate-ecosystem modeling capacity. The meeting included a mixture of presentations, discussions and hands-on tutorials. Workshop sessions visited key topics including:

(1) understanding attribution and advancing skill testing in ecosystem models;

(2) representing temperature-dependencies and other climate forcings in ecosystem models;

(3) improving methods for downscaling climate projections in both data-rich and data-limited regions;

(4) evaluating whether global climate projections represent important regional-scale ecosystem processes.
