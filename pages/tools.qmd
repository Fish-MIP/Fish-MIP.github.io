# Data and Tools

We are developing a wide range of community tools and apps for ecosystem modelers and policy end-users of our simulation data.
Please check our [Terms of Use](https://www.isimip.org/gettingstarted/terms-of-use/){target="_blank"} (via ISIMIP) if you would like to use these data for peer-reviewed research.

## FishMIP Shiny

[Country-level Ensemble Model Outputs](https://rstudio.global-ecosystem-model.cloud.edu.au/shiny/FAO_report_shiny/){target="_blank"}:
Check out our Shinyapp (beta version) to visualise spatially aggregated data of projected changes in potential fish biomass, under alternative climate emission scenarios.

[Input Explorer for Regional Modellers](https://rstudio.global-ecosystem-model.cloud.edu.au/shiny/FishMIP_Input_Explorer/){target="_blank"}:
A Shinyapp to examine inputs per regional ecosystem model domain.

## Tutorials

R/Python tutorials for extracting data from ISIMIP servers, regional-scale model inputs from global gridded Earth System Models, or plotting outputs from FishMIP, using a regional shapefiles.
