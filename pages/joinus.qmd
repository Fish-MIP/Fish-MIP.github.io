```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
library(readxl)

#Read data from file
datab <- read_excel("../fishmipmembers11042024_V2.xlsx")

# Add a small offset to the latitude and longitude coordinates- increasing this will cause points to move significantly- CAUTION
offset <- seq(0, 0.1, length.out = nrow(datab))

# Jitter the latitude and longitude coordinates
jittered_lat <- datab$lat + offset
jittered_lon <- datab$long + offset

# Create Leaflet map
m <- leaflet(data = datab) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lng = ~jittered_lon, lat = ~jittered_lat, popup = paste("Name: ", datab$Name, "<br> Affiliation: ", datab$Affiliation, "<br> Model: ", datab$Model), clusterOptions = NULL)
 # Disable wrapping to prevent continents from appearing twice
  options(wrap = FALSE)
  # Set the minimum zoom level to ensure the whole world map is visible
