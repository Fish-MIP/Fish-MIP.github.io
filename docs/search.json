Our marine ecosystem models are both at global and regional scales, and vary widely in terms of how they represent food-web or ecosystem components and the links between them.

    "text": "SIMULATION PROTOCOLS\n\nFishMIP Model Evaluation Protocol [ISIMIP 3a]\nThe goal of the FishMIP Model Evaluation Protocol [3a] is to understand and reduce uncertainty associated with FishMIP models through model evaluation under historical climate and fishing effort forcings.\n\nThis information will allow FishMIP to better target policy initiatives such as IPCC and IPBES by providing more robust uncertainty assessment, as well as advancing the state of FishMIP models for informing vulnerability, impact, and adaptation plans of coastal sea ecosystems and fisheries (requested by the FAO).\n\nThe focus of papers produced from this simulation round will be a significant advance in at least two ways:\n\nforcing models with higher spatial resolution global climate models and reconstructed historical fishing effort and\nassessment of models against reconstructed historical catches (as well as biomass and other fisheries and ecological metrics in regions where additional data are available).\n\nUploading simulations by January 30th 2023 is essential to ensure enough time for analysis and writing of manuscripts in time for submission to the FishMIP 10 Year Anniversary Special Issue planned for 2023. If you are able to upload results sooner, that would be helpful. If you need more time, please let us know as soon as possible.\nProgress towards this deadline will be supported and facilitated through monthly global and regional modeller workshops from to:\n\nEnsure correct ESM model inputs and access\nEnsure fishing drivers work (separate global and regional breakaway groups)\nTool sharing & troubleshooting\nCheck model outputs/issues\nBrainstorming and drafting papers (initially methods and preliminary results)\n\nThe FishMIP 2022 protocol can be downloaded from here while the official ISIMIP3 protocol is located on this website.\n\n\n\n\nEarlier phases:\n\n\nFishMIP Phase 1 2020\nThe goal of FishMIP Phase 1 2020 is to provide input to the IPCC WGII AR6 report. This necessitates submitting a manuscript by November 1 st 2020. The focus of this simulation round will be on (a) new FishMIP outputs using climate scenarios from the CMIP6 earth-system model forcings; (b) exploring fishing impacts in addition to those of climate; (c) comparison to a no-climate change pre-industrial control baseline (which was not available for the last round of simulations), and (d) if possible, validation against observed catches.\nNote that this FishMIP Phase 1 protocol represents only a subset of the full ISIMIP3b protocol with a smaller set of scenarios considered. The FishMIP Phase 2 2021 protocol will build upon these experiments.\nThe FishMIP Phase 1 (2020) protocol can be downloaded here while the official ISIMIP3 protocol is located on this website.\n\n\nISIMIP2a\nThe ISIMIP2a simulation protocol represents the choices we have made in order to compare as many global and regional models as possible. These include common inputs with respect to climate, physical and chemical data (temperature, currents, salinity, pH, oxygen), biological data (e.g. primary production, phyto- and zooplankton), and fisheries data (effort, catch, fisheries mortality) as well as common outputs including fish biomass and catch as well as other ecosystem parameters."
