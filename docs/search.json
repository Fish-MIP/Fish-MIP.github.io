    "text": "The goal of the FishMIP Model Evaluation Protocol [3a] is to understand and reduce uncertainty associated with FishMIP models through model evaluation under historical climate and fishing effort forcings.\n\nThis information will allow FishMIP to better target policy initiatives such as IPCC and IPBES by providing more robust uncertainty assessment, as well as advancing the state of FishMIP models for informing vulnerability, impact, and adaptation plans of coastal sea ecosystems and fisheries (requested by the FAO).\n\nThe focus of papers produced from this simulation round will be a significant advance in at least two ways:\n\nforcing models with higher spatial resolution global climate models and reconstructed historical fishing effort and\nassessment of models against reconstructed historical catches (as well as biomass and other fisheries and ecological metrics in regions where additional data are available).\n\nUploading simulations by January 30th 2023 is essential to ensure enough time for analysis and writing of manuscripts in time for submission to the FishMIP 10 Year Anniversary Special Issue planned for 2023. If you are able to upload results sooner, that would be helpful. If you need more time, please let us know as soon as possible.\nProgress towards this deadline will be supported and facilitated through monthly global and regional modeller workshops from to:\n\nEnsure correct ESM model inputs and access\nEnsure fishing drivers work (separate global and regional breakaway groups)\nTool sharing & troubleshooting\nCheck model outputs/issues\nBrainstorming and drafting papers (initially methods and preliminary results)\n\nThe FishMIP Model Evaluation protocol can be downloaded from here while the official ISIMIP3 protocol is located on this website."

    "section": "",
    "text": "FishMIP CMIP6 Phase 1\nThe goal of FishMIP CMIP6 Phase 1 (commenced in 2020) is to provide input to the IPCC WGII AR6 report. This necessitates submitting a manuscript by November 1st 2020. The focus of this simulation round will be on (a) new FishMIP outputs using climate scenarios from the CMIP6 earth-system model forcings; (b) exploring fishing impacts in addition to those of climate; (c) comparison to a no-climate change pre-industrial control baseline (which was not available for the last round of simulations), and (d) if possible, validation against observed catches.\nNote that this FishMIP CMIP6 Phase 1 protocol represents only a subset of the full ISIMIP3b protocol with a smaller set of scenarios considered. The FishMIP CMIP6 Phase 2 protocol will build upon these experiments in 2023.\nThe FishMIP CMIP6 Phase 1 (contributing to ISIMIP3b) protocol can be downloaded here while the official ISIMIP3 protocol is located on this website."

    "text": "Core FishMIP-OSP members at virtual kick-off meeting\n\n\nIn early May, an exciting new initiative was launched — the FishMIP-OSP Project. That’s right, another project packed with acronyms! This project sets out to forecast the future of global fisheries using the Ocean System Pathways (OSPs) scenarios, which outline both historical and projected socio-economic conditions for pelagic and bentho-demersal fisheries, as well as mariculture.\nThe FishMIP-OSP project will provide to the FishMIP modeling community the models and drivers needed to simulate fisheries with any ecosystem model. It will streamline and standardize the data inputs and evaluation methods needed to assess the framework. It will also establish the simulation protocols required by the scientific community to produce ensemble projections of marine ecosystems and fisheries, as well as to evaluate historical simulations. The analysis will explore key issues such as climate justice, global food security, equity between the Global North and South, the future of mariculture, and biodiversity protection.\nUltimately, the project’s findings seek to inform policymaking at the FAO and contribute to upcoming IPCC and IPBES assessments.\nFunded by and with active facilitation of the Centre for the Synthesis and Analysis of Biodiversity (CESAB), this project will run from 2025 – 2028 and bring together specialists in marine ecology, biodiversity, fisheries, fisheries economics, fisheries policy, ecosystem and fleet modeling, climate change, statistical analyses, and scenarios, on a regular basis, either in person or virtually.\nThis May, the core project team met virtually, some more awake than others, as the locations of the diverse team members span multiple time zones, ranging from North America to central Europe, to Oceania.\nAt the meeting, the project team discussed the roles and contributions of the FishMIP-OSP project members, including the need for a comprehensive communication strategy (btw. you can now find FishMIP on LinkedIn and Bluesky) to reach different user groups and the coordination with the International FishMIP community. The team also discussed the project’s timeline, with a focus on the upcoming September in-person meeting.\nFrom 8-12 September 2025, the project team will meet in person in the CESAB offices in Montpellier, France. Stay tuned for project updates on this blog or on FishMIP’s social media."

Workshop sessions visited key topics including:\n\nUnderstanding attribution and advancing skill testing in ecosystem models.\nRepresenting temperature-dependencies and other climate forcings in ecosystem models.\nImproving methods for downscaling climate projections in both data-rich and data-limited regions.\nEvaluating whether global climate projections represent important regional-scale ecosystem processes.\n\nOur workshop in Honolulu was also a moment of full circle, as we gathered in the very birthplace of Ecopath. As part of the National Marine Fisheries Service in Hawaii, Jeffrey Polovina and colleagues developed this modeling framework to describe the flow of energy through a specific food web, and has since been expanded, refined and applied to ecosystems throughout the world. Even FishMIP is using Ecopath for several regions, including Southeast Australia, East Antarctica, and the California Current.\nThe joint workshop was a success with new ideas and collaborations formed, all inspired by the beauty of Hawaii."

    "text": "Policymakers, scientists, climate experts, and environmental activists came together for the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) to negotiate agreements to address our Earth’s climate emergency. On their agenda: curbing emissions to avoid global warming beyond 1.5°C. Efforts to achieve this will have to include our vast and diverse ocean ecosystems, and COP26 addressed both the climate and biodiversity crises as one, including the protection of marine ecosystems. Climate change caused by humans is a growing threat to marine ecosystems; its impacts projected to intensify for marine animals, including increased mortality and changing distributions, interactions, and biomass. Adding other stressors, like overfishing, the societal benefits from the ocean and marine conservation efforts are also under threat.\n\n\n\nImage credit: Francesco Ungaro on Unsplash\n\n\nTo assess future climate change impacts on marine ecosystems and the wider consequences for human wellbeing modeling studies are required. Here, the so-called ensemble model approach has become the gold standard in climate-impact sciences; an approach that combines different models into ensembles that give valuable insights and confidence measures for potential future climate change impacts. For the ocean, the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Modeling Project (Fish-MIP) provide a platform for global and regional marine ecosystem model ensembles. Initiated about 10 years ago, it is now in its second iteration, where an ensemble of nine global ecosystem models projects marine ecosystem changes throughout the 21st century under new and improved climate scenarios.\nEach marine ecosystem model within the Fish-MIP ensemble is coupled to a climate model from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) that provides improved projections of, for example, ocean temperature, important ocean currents, and primary production. The benefit of FISH-MIP and the ensemble approach is that through combining different marine ecosystem models, we can get a broader representation of ecosystem dynamics, and systematically assess uncertainties associated with different model structures and assumptions. Being able to do this, facilitates any advice on future states of marine ecosystems and the fisheries millions of people rely on every day.\nThe improved model ensemble highlights an increased climate risk for marine ecosystems. More specifically, the improved projections showed that with warming waters and changing habitats, global biomass of marine animals will decline more drastically than previously assessed. Those declines are higher under the climate change scenario that tracks the trajectory we are on today. Declines under a climate change scenario, in line with the Paris Agreement from 2015, that would limit global warming to 1.5°C by the end of the 21st century, are much weaker, emphasizing the importance to curb global emissions and mitigate wider ecosystem changes and societal consequences.\nThe study sheds light on future pathways towards ocean sustainability and contributed to the sixth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Report; a report that provides governments at all levels with evidence-based information they can use to develop effective climate policies that ultimately affects everyone on this planet.\nRead the publication here: Tittensor et al. 2021 Nature Climate Change."

Contrary to everyone’s belief, the sun was shining and stayed with us all week. The occasion that brought us together — the 5th Symposium on the Effects of Climate Change on the World’s Ocean. At this symposium, scientists from all corners of the world highlighted the latest information on how oceans are changing, the inherent risks that come with those changes, and strategies for increasing climate resilience, mitigation, and adaptation.\n\n\n\nFishMIP coordinators and modelers at ECCWO5.\n\n\nA busy week lay ahead. FishMIP members organized several sessions during the conference, each with their own purpose and venue. FishMIP convened an all-day session on the Advances in coupling regional climate and social-ecological models to improve climate-ready ecosystem management, which highlighted current approaches and identified critical gaps for coupling climate models to regional social-ecological systems. Ryan Heneghan, FishMIP modeller (ZOOMSS) and keynote speaker for this session, presented his thoughts on FishMIP projections, uncertainties, grand challenges, and solutions to make climate change model simulations more equitable. Other session speakers, presented on modeling efforts that integrate climate impacts across spatial and temporal scales, and emphasized approaches to incorporate statistically or dynamically downscaled climate projections into single species, food web, and social-ecological projections. As part of this session, research posters were displayed during an evening poster session, that showed some of the latest, applied science using global FishMIP projections.\n\n\n\nRyan Heneghan giving his keynote talk at ECCWO5 (Image by Tyler D. Eddy)\n\n\nTo mix the heavy science up a bit, FishMIP held a special information session during one of the scrumptious lunches at the conference hotel. The room was packed with known and unknown faces to learn more about FishMIP and out upcoming species collection “Past and Future Marine Ecosystems” in Earth’s Future celebrating the 10 years anniversary of FishMIP. Old and new coordinators introduced themselves to the room and highlighted the many benefits of being part of FishMIP. To name a few — high-impact publications (e.g., Nature Climate Change, PNAS, Nature Ecology Evolution, Global Change Biology), contributing to global climate and biodiversity policy efforts (e.g., IPCC, IPBES), supportive and amazing collaborators from across the globe, international workshops, and fun.\nECCWO5 was a fruitful week, full of great questions and deep discussions.

During this meeting, a wide variety of plenary sessions and parallel meetings took place and individual sectors (e.g., forest, water, fisheries, agriculture, permafrost, health, lakes) provided updates on recent simulation results as well as initiatives to properly address representative key risks highlighted in the IPCC report. Myself, Julia Blanchard, Camilla Novaglio and Tyler Eddy participated in an afternoon panel session to present recent Fish-MIP results to the broader ISIMIP community on pathways to reduce uncertainties in the marine ecosystem models and mismatches in global vs. regional model climate projections, respectively.\nDuring the closed sessions, the FishMIP community used the in-person, dedicated time to discuss the next protocol centered around the oceanic system pathways (OSPs) and how they will soon be integrated into the global models. The OSPs, developed by Olivier Maury, are extensions of the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) and representative concentration pathways (RCPs) with a total of five unique scenarios. Similar to the SSPs, the OSPs take into account climate change effects but extend the storyline to incorporate important drivers in the fishery world, such as demand in terms of human population sizes, gross domestic products, fisheries fleet dynamics, and fisheries management rules. The logistics of harmonizing the OSPs to the global FishMIP models were mapped out alongside target timelines for future meetings.

    "text": "Workshop attendees cheerfully gather outside for a group shot despite the freezing cold weather\n\n\nIn June 2025, a group of 20+ scientists from all over the world gathered in chilly Hobart, Tasmania and online to address a critical challenge- How do we tackle uncertainties in climate change models to provide meaningful advice for policymakers and other stakeholders?. This four-day workshop “Advancing Regional Marine Ecosystem Modelling: From Southern Ocean to Global Perspectives” brought together researchers at various career stages. \nHosted by the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS), University of Tasmania and co-funded by Australian Centre for Excellence in Antarctic Science (ACEAS), the Australian Antarctic Program Partnership (AAPP), and The Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project (FishMIP), the workshop discussions were collaborative, forward-looking and highlighted the urgency and complexity of modelling marine ecosystems in a changing climate. \n\n\n\nDr Kieran Murphy (IMAS, UTAS and workshop coordinator) discussing progress made in Southern Ocean modelling\n\n\nA central theme was the challenge of uncertainties in ecosystem models with a specific focus on southern ocean regional models as it is data-deficient. While FishMIP 2.0 has made significant advancements in standardising inputs and outputs and incorporating fishing impacts, regional models still face difficulties in downscaling global climate data and capturing fine-scale ecological processes. This is partly due to the diversity of regional models, each built for different purposes under varying assumptions. \n\n\n\n\nDr Kelly Ortega-Cisneros (University of Cape Town) describing progress made in regional modelling\n\n\nPresentations from Dr Kelly Ortega-Cisneros (FishMIP regional modelling lead) and Kieran Murphy (IMAS, workshop lead coordinator) highlighted ongoing efforts to develop standardised workflows and protocols, such as the Southern Ocean Marine Ecosystem Model Ensemble (SOMEME), to improve consistency and reduce variability across models. \nThe group also discussed the limitations of current Earth system models, the need for “ensemble approaches” and the importance of linking regional and global models to better inform fisheries management and ecosystem conservation strategies. \nA highlight of the workshop was the hands-on session on AI-assisted ecosystem modelling, led by Dr Scott Spillias (CSIRO) and Dr Kieran Murphy. The participants explored how large language models (LLMs) and coding agents like Roo and Github Copilot can be used to assist model development, calibration and code translation. Activities included generating diet matrices, converting codes from one language to another and visualizing model outputs. \nWhile the potential of AI was clear, participants also acknowledged its limitations, emphasising the need for human oversight and careful validation of AI-generated models.\n\n\n\nProf Julia Blanchard (IMAS, UTAS, FishMIP lead) introducing the Ocean system pathways (OSPs) framework\n\n\nProf Julia Blanchard (FishMIP lead)  introduced the Ocean System Pathways (OSPs) framework to align ecosystem modelling with socioeconomic scenarios. The OSP framework narratives range from sustainability-first to high-tech market driven futures and aims to contextualise shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) within fisheries and ocean governance. Translating these storylines into quantitative model inputs is a key goal for the next phase of FishMIP. This integration of human dimensions ensures that the future FishMIP projections are not only scientifically robust but also socially relevant.  \nThe workshop closed with reflections from participants across career stages. Many appreciated the diversity of expertise, collaborative atmosphere and the opportunity to engage with new ideas and tools. \nAs climate change continues to reshape our oceans, the FishMIP community remains committed to advancing science that informs sustainable and resilient marine futures."

We are currently running simulation experiments to evaluate models for how well they can detect past ecosystem and fisheries changes and to work towards an attribution framework.\nMore information on our current protocol (contributing to ISIMIP 3a) can be found here.\nFishMIP model outputs from past simulation rounds can be found here.
