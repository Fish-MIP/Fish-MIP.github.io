    "text": "THE CHALLENGE\nMarine ecosystem models use very different basic structures to represent food-web or ecosystem components and the links between them. Ecosystem components can be represented by size classes, functional groups, trophic levels, species groups, and life-history stages, whereas links can be represented by who-eats-whom networks, diet composition or energy transfer. Another challenge is that our models do not all use the same input and output variables. Finally, there are limited observational data for historical runs and model validation, and limited data on spatially resolved fishing effort.\n\n\nSIMULATION PROTOCOLS\n\nFishMIP Model Evaluation Protocol [ISIMIP 3a]\nThe goal of the FishMIP Model Evaluation Protocol [3a] is to understand and reduce uncertainty associated with FishMIP models through model evaluation under historical climate and fishing effort forcings.\n\nThis information will allow FishMIP to better target policy initiatives such as IPCC and IPBES by providing more robust uncertainty assessment, as well as advancing the state of FishMIP models for informing vulnerability, impact, and adaptation plans of coastal sea ecosystems and fisheries (requested by the FAO).\n\nThe focus of papers produced from this simulation round will be a significant advance in at least two ways:\n\nforcing models with higher spatial resolution global climate models and reconstructed historical fishing effort and\nassessment of models against reconstructed historical catches (as well as biomass and other fisheries and ecological metrics in regions where additional data are available).\n\nUploading simulations by January 30th 2023 is essential to ensure enough time for analysis and writing of manuscripts in time for submission to the FishMIP 10 Year Anniversary Special Issue planned for 2023. If you are able to upload results sooner, that would be helpful. If you need more time, please let us know as soon as possible.\nProgress towards this deadline will be supported and facilitated through monthly global and regional modeller workshops from to:\n\nEnsure correct ESM model inputs and access\nEnsure fishing drivers work (separate global and regional breakaway groups)\nTool sharing & troubleshooting\nCheck model outputs/issues\nBrainstorming and drafting papers (initially methods and preliminary results)\n\nThe FishMIP Model Evaluation protocol can be downloaded from here while the official ISIMIP3 protocol is located on this website.\n\n\n\n\nEarlier and ongoing simulation rounds:\n\n\nFishMIP CMIP6 Phase 1\nThe goal of FishMIP CMIP6 Phase 1 (commenced in 2020) is to provide input to the IPCC WGII AR6 report. This necessitates submitting a manuscript by November 1st 2020. The focus of this simulation round will be on (a) new FishMIP outputs using climate scenarios from the CMIP6 earth-system model forcings; (b) exploring fishing impacts in addition to those of climate; (c) comparison to a no-climate change pre-industrial control baseline (which was not available for the last round of simulations), and (d) if possible, validation against observed catches.\nNote that this FishMIP CMIP6 Phase 1 protocol represents only a subset of the full ISIMIP3b protocol with a smaller set of scenarios considered. The FishMIP CMIP6 Phase 2 protocol will build upon these experiments in 2023.\nThe FishMIP CMIP6 Phase 1 (contributing to ISIMIP3b) protocol can be downloaded here while the official ISIMIP3 protocol is located on this website.\n\n\nFishMIP CMIP5 (ISIMIP2)\nThe first two rounds of FishMIP simulation protocols were aligned with CMIP5 under the ISIMIP 2 Simulation Round. The ISIMIP2a simulation protocol represents the choices we have made in order to compare as many global and regional models as possible. These include common inputs with respect to climate, physical and chemical data (temperature, currents, salinity, pH, oxygen), biological data (e.g. primary production, phyto- and zooplankton), and fisheries data (effort, catch, fisheries mortality) as well as common outputs including fish biomass and catch as well as other ecosystem parameters."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Latest climate change projections reveal higher risks for marine ecosystems\n\nAuthor: Dr Andrea Bryndum-Buccholz; Memorial University of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada\nPolicymakers, scientists, climate experts, and environmental activists came together for the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) to negotiate agreements to address our Earth’s climate emergency. On their agenda: curbing emissions to avoid global warming beyond 1.5°C. Efforts to achieve this will have to include our vast and diverse ocean ecosystems, and COP26 addressed both the climate and biodiversity crises as one, including the protection of marine ecosystems. Climate change caused by humans is a growing threat to marine ecosystems; its impacts projected to intensify for marine animals, including increased mortality and changing distributions, interactions, and biomass. Adding other stressors, like overfishing, the societal benefits from the ocean and marine conservation efforts are also under threat.\nTo assess future climate change impacts on marine ecosystems and the wider consequences for human wellbeing modeling studies are required. Here, the so-called ensemble model approach has become the gold standard in climate-impact sciences; an approach that combines different models into ensembles that give valuable insights and confidence measures for potential future climate change impacts. For the ocean, the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Modeling Project (Fish-MIP) provide a platform for global and regional marine ecosystem model ensembles. Initiated about 10 years ago, it is now in its second iteration, where an ensemble of nine global ecosystem models projects marine ecosystem changes throughout the 21st century under new and improved climate scenarios.\nEach marine ecosystem model within the Fish-MIP ensemble is coupled to a climate model from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) that provides improved projections of, for example, ocean temperature, important ocean currents, and primary production. The benefit of FISH-MIP and the ensemble approach is that through combining different marine ecosystem models, we can get a broader representation of ecosystem dynamics, and systematically assess uncertainties associated with different model structures and assumptions. Being able to do this, facilitates any advice on future states of marine ecosystems and the fisheries millions of people rely on every day.\nThe improved model ensemble highlights an increased climate risk for marine ecosystems. More specifically, the improved projections showed that with warming waters and changing habitats, global biomass of marine animals will decline more drastically than previously assessed. Those declines are higher under the climate change scenario that tracks the trajectory we are on today. Declines under a climate change scenario, in line with the Paris Agreement from 2015, that would limit global warming to 1.5°C by the end of the 21st century, are much weaker, emphasizing the importance to curb global emissions and mitigate wider ecosystem changes and societal consequences.\nThe study sheds light on future pathways towards ocean sustainability and contributed to the sixth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Report; a report that provides governments at all levels with evidence-based information they can use to develop effective climate policies that ultimately affects everyone on this planet.\nRead the publication here: Tittensor et al. 2021 Nature Climate Change"

    "text": "Future scenarios in the making, in historical Prague\n\nby Kelsey Roberts\nIn June, several members of FishMIP attended and presented at the cross-sectoral ISIMIP-PROCLIAS workshop in Prague, Czech Republic. During this meeting, a wide variety of plenary sessions and parallel meetings took place and individual sectors (e.g., forest, water, fisheries, agriculture, permafrost, health, lakes) provided updates on recent simulation results as well as initiatives to properly address representative key risks highlighted in the IPCC report. Myself, Julia Blanchard, Camilla Novaglio and Tyler Eddy participated in an afternoon panel session to present recent Fish-MIP results to the broader ISIMIP community on pathways to reduce uncertainties in the marine ecosystem models and mismatches in global vs. regional model climate projections, respectively.\nDuring the closed sessions, the FishMIP community used the in-person, dedicated time to discuss the next protocol centered around the oceanic system pathways (OSPs) and how they will soon be integrated into the global models. The OSPs, developed by Olivier Maury, are extensions of the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) and representative concentration pathways (RCPs) with a total of five unique scenarios. Similar to the SSPs, the OSPs take into account climate change effects but extend the storyline to incorporate important drivers in the fishery world, such as demand in terms of human population sizes, gross domestic products, fisheries fleet dynamics, and fisheries management rules. The logistics of harmonizing the OSPs to the global FishMIP models were mapped out alongside target timelines for future meetings. In their downtime, the in-person FishMIP team explored the historic city of Prague and frequented restaurants with the best views of the beautiful Charles Bridge.\n\n\n\nThe in-person FishMIP team in the historic city of Prague, with the Charles Bridge in the background."

The meeting included a mixture of presentations, discussions and hands-on tutorials. Workshop sessions visited key topics including:\n\nunderstanding attribution and advancing skill testing in ecosystem models;\nrepresenting temperature-dependencies and other climate forcings in ecosystem models;\nimproving methods for downscaling climate projections in both data-rich and data-limited regions;\nevaluating whether global climate projections represent important regional-scale ecosystem processes."

    "text": "Bergen: Fish-MIP at ECCWO5 by Andrea Bryndum-Buchholz\n\n\n\nFish-MIP coordinators and modelers at ECCWO5.\n\n\nThis spring, Fish-MIP coordinators and modellers descended on the beautiful city of Bergen, on Norway’s west coast. Contrary to everyone’s believe, the sun was shining and stayed with us all week. The occasion that brought us together — the 5th Symposium on the Effects of Climate Change on the World’s Ocean. At this symposium, scientists from all corners of the world highlighted the latest information on how oceans are changing, the inherent risks that come with those changes, and strategies for increasing climate resilience, mitigation, and adaptation.\nA busy week lay ahead. Fish-MIP members organized several sessions during the conference, each with their own purpose and venue. Fish-MIP convened an all-day session on the Advances in coupling regional climate and social-ecological models to improve climate-ready ecosystem management, which highlighted current approaches and identified critical gaps for coupling climate models to regional social-ecological systems. Ryan Heneghan, FishMIP modeller (ZOOMSS) and keynote speaker for this session, presented his thoughts on Fish-MIP projections, uncertainties, grand challenges, and solutions to make climate change model simulations more equitable. Other session speakers, presented on modeling efforts that integrate climate impacts across spatial and temporal scales, and emphasized approaches to incorporate statistically or dynamically downscaled climate projections into single species, food web, and social-ecological projections. As part of this session, research posters were displayed during an evening poster session, that showed some of the latest, applied science using global Fish-MIP projections.\n\n\n\nRyan Heneghan giving his keynote talk at ECCWO5 (Image by Tyler D. Eddy)\n\n\nTo mix the heavy science up a bit, Fish-MIP held a special information session during one of the scrumptious lunches at the conference hotel. The room was packed with known and unknown faces to learn more about FishMIP and out upcoming species collection “Past and Future Marine Ecosystems” in Earth’s Future celebrating the 10 years anniversary of Fish-MIP. Old and new coordinators introduced themselves to the room and highlighted the many benefits of being part of FishMIP. To name a few — high-impact publications (e.g., Nature Climate Change, PNAS, Nature Ecology Evolution, Global Change Biology), contributing to global climate and biodiversity policy efforts (e.g., IPCC, IPBES), supportive and amazing collaborators from across the globe, international workshops, and fun.\nECCWO5 was a fruitful week, full of great questions and deep discussions. We left Bergen, having met new collaborators and with new ideas in our heads and smiles on our faces, looking forward to our next meeting in Hawaii."

    "text": "We use an ensemble modelling approach to combine the results from multiple ecosystem models, all forced by standardized inputs and scenarios. We use combinations of Earth System Models (ESMs) and representative concentration pathways (RCPs) to provide model inputs, along with simplified fishing scenarios. Our marine ecosystem models are both at global and regional scales, and vary widely in terms of how they represent food-web or ecosystem components and the links between them. Ecosystem components can be represented by size classes, functional groups, trophic levels, species groups, and life-history stages, whereas links can be represented by who-eats-whom networks, diet composition or energy transfer.\n\n\n\nImage credit: Boyce, D.

FishMIP model outputs from simulation round 2(a) are publicly available and can be found here.

The ISIMIP2a simulation protocol represents the choices we have made in order to compare as many global and regional models as possible. These include common inputs with respect to climate, physical and chemical data (temperature, currents, salinity, pH, oxygen), biological data (e.g. primary production, phyto- and zooplankton), and fisheries data (effort, catch, fisheries mortality) as well as common outputs including fish biomass and catch as well as other ecosystem parameters."
