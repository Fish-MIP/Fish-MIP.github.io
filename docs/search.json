    "text": "THE CHALLENGE\nMarine ecosystem models use very different basic structures to represent food-web or ecosystem components and the links between them. Ecosystem components can be represented by size classes, functional groups, trophic levels, species groups, and life-history stages, whereas links can be represented by who-eats-whom networks, diet composition or energy transfer. Another challenge is that our models do not all use the same input and output variables. Finally, there are limited observational data for historical runs and model validation, and limited data on spatially resolved fishing effort.\n\n\nSIMULATION PROTOCOLS\n\nFishMIP Model Evaluation Protocol [ISIMIP 3a]\nThe goal of the FishMIP Model Evaluation Protocol [3a] is to understand and reduce uncertainty associated with FishMIP models through model evaluation under historical climate and fishing effort forcings.\n\nThis information will allow FishMIP to better target policy initiatives such as IPCC and IPBES by providing more robust uncertainty assessment, as well as advancing the state of FishMIP models for informing vulnerability, impact, and adaptation plans of coastal sea ecosystems and fisheries (requested by the FAO).\n\nThe focus of papers produced from this simulation round will be a significant advance in at least two ways:\n\nforcing models with higher spatial resolution global climate models and reconstructed historical fishing effort and\nassessment of models against reconstructed historical catches (as well as biomass and other fisheries and ecological metrics in regions where additional data are available).\n\nUploading simulations by January 30th 2023 is essential to ensure enough time for analysis and writing of manuscripts in time for submission to the FishMIP 10 Year Anniversary Special Issue planned for 2023. If you are able to upload results sooner, that would be helpful. If you need more time, please let us know as soon as possible.\nProgress towards this deadline will be supported and facilitated through monthly global and regional modeller workshops from to:\n\nEnsure correct ESM model inputs and access\nEnsure fishing drivers work (separate global and regional breakaway groups)\nTool sharing & troubleshooting\nCheck model outputs/issues\nBrainstorming and drafting papers (initially methods and preliminary results)\n\nThe FishMIP Model Evaluation protocol can be downloaded from here while the official ISIMIP3 protocol is located on this website.\n\n\n\n\nEarlier and ongoing simulation rounds:\n\n\nFishMIP CMIP6 Phase 1\nThe goal of FishMIP CMIP6 Phase 1 (commenced in 2020) is to provide input to the IPCC WGII AR6 report. This necessitates submitting a manuscript by November 1st 2020. The focus of this simulation round will be on (a) new FishMIP outputs using climate scenarios from the CMIP6 earth-system model forcings; (b) exploring fishing impacts in addition to those of climate; (c) comparison to a no-climate change pre-industrial control baseline (which was not available for the last round of simulations), and (d) if possible, validation against observed catches.\nNote that this FishMIP CMIP6 Phase 1 protocol represents only a subset of the full ISIMIP3b protocol with a smaller set of scenarios considered. The FishMIP CMIP6 Phase 2 protocol will build upon these experiments in 2023.\nThe FishMIP CMIP6 Phase 1 (contributing to ISIMIP3b) protocol can be downloaded here while the official ISIMIP3 protocol is located on this website.\n\n\nFishMIP CMIP5 (ISIMIP2)\nThe first two rounds of FishMIP simulation protocols were aligned with CMIP5 under the ISIMIP 2 Simulation Round. The ISIMIP2a simulation protocol represents the choices we have made in order to compare as many global and regional models as possible. These include common inputs with respect to climate, physical and chemical data (temperature, currents, salinity, pH, oxygen), biological data (e.g. primary production, phyto- and zooplankton), and fisheries data (effort, catch, fisheries mortality) as well as common outputs including fish biomass and catch as well as other ecosystem parameters."

The meeting will include a mixture of presentations, discussions and hands-on tutorials. Workshop sessions will visit key topics including:\n\nunderstanding attribution and advancing skill testing in ecosystem models;\nrepresenting temperature-dependencies and other climate forcings in ecosystem models;\nimproving methods for downscaling climate projections in both data-rich and data-limited regions;\nevaluating whether global climate projections represent important regional-scale ecosystem processes.\n\nThe general format Tuesday through Thursday will include presentations and discussions in the morning followed by interactive activities in the afternoon. Friday will be dedicated to FishMIP business and focus on preparing regional modelers for contributing to FishMIP simulations. Virtual attendance will be facilitated.\nLimited travel support is available for non-US citizen early career scientists and scientists from developing nations. Applications for travel support must be obtained by May 15, 2023.\nRegular online modeller meetings - To assist with simulation rounds we meet regularly with modelers to troubleshoot any issues and implementation. Please contact regional and global model coordinators to join these.\n\n\nRecent past events:\nFishMIP Community Virtual Meeting, January 27th, 2023 (7-9 am AEDT)\nThe FishMIP 2022 International Workshop took place in St John’s, Newfoundland Canada and online, Oct 3-7th.\n\nThe workshop was co-funded by the SOMBEE project, The Fisheries and Marine Institute of memorial University of Newfoundland and The Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies, University of Tasmania. We supported travel for seven Early Career Researchers were supported to attend this meeting.\nFull programme including abstracts here.\nAccess to slides and recordings are available on request.\nThe ISIMIP-Proclias cross-sectoral workshop took place 16-19th May 2022.
