We are developing a wide range of community tools and apps for ecosystem modelers and policy end-users of our simulation data.

Please check our publication policy if you would like to use these data for peer-reviewed research.

#### FishMIP Explorer

Coming soon! Check out this Shiny app to visualise gridded or spatially aggregated data of projected changes in potential fish biomass, under alternative climate emission scenarios.

#### Tutorials

R/Python tutorials for extracting data from ISIMIP servers, regional-scale model inputs from global gridded Earth System Models, or plotting outputs from FishMIP, using a regional shapefiles.
